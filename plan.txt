User Experience
--> searches for a subject
--> selects top five videos that they want (this solves problem of repeated info)
--> can choose to subscribe to same topic every week (new videos will appear to choose from) or have it be one time
--> a video and audio flash briefing is created for that topic and saved to its "folder" with timestamp (weekly, if they so choose)

Other Functionality
- manage subscriptions 
- view different folders containing flash briefings
- share the briefings
- provide links to the full videos (that are flashed into one)
- option to automate the selection of videos

Preliminary Steps
* First: decide if Dart + Flutter can be used for all of these functions
1. Create basic app
2. Allow Google Video search within the app
3. Allow choice of videos
4. Cut videos into a flash briefing that stops with speech
